## Session 1: Overview of matrix computations and tensors

## Session 2: Matrix computations (cont.) and tensor decompositions

## Session 3: Tensor decompositions (cont.)

## Session 4: Tensor networks and algorithms

## Session 5: Lab session

## Session 6: Tensor network computational challenges, applications, algorithms (+mini exam)

## Session 7: Research paper presentations

# Evaluation

Your course grade will be calculated as follows:

1. Graded lab assignment (5/20)

2. In-class mini-exam (5/20)

3. Research paper presentation (10/20)

* In-class mini-exam will be on the subjects covered in the first five sessions. You can bring ** four A4 sheets ** (eight pages recto-verso) with your notes to use during the exam. No other material or electronics is allowed. The exam will be around 1 hour, at the end of Session 6.

* Research paper list will be announced later in the course.

* Session 7 will be held in two seperate slots (one for QDCS one for QMI students. You are welcome to join both if your calendar permits).
